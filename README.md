XML Plugin Format
-----------------
The Marketplace XML is shared between Pentaho's BA Server and Kettle, but at 
this time there are some feature differences.  Each element below specifies whether it's available in the two marketplaces.

What is the review process for the plugin?
------------------------------------------
At this time, the review process is informal, and can be done by any of the core 
committers of the marketplace-metadata project.  The core committers will review 
the plugin submission, and if accepted, will accept the pull request.

  
Version.xml: What is it and why should I use it?
------------------------------------------
 
version.xml is a file used by marketplace to determine which version of your plugin your user has installed.
This will allow the marketplace to tell the user when a new version is available and he can update your plugin.
The version.xml file should be located in the plugin root folder (where plugin.xml is) and it must follow
the following format:

    <version branch='<branch>' buildId='<buildId>'><versionNumber></version>

 * &lt;branch&gt; - This should be the branch from where this build originated (stable or trunk, but you can use 
 whatever you want - GA, RC, etc)
 * &lt;versionNumber&gt; - The plugin version. Can be a complex string
 *  &lt;buildId&gt; - This is used to differentiate between two versions who share the same version number. For instance,
 snapshot builds that usually have the same version (TRUNK-SNAPSHOT) can still be distinguished if the buildId is
 different. 
 
###Development Stage

The development stage is a project maturity classification with a two-lane approach.

* __Customer Lane__: Always overseen by PM and Engineering, projects in the Customer Lane can either start as customer-sponsored initiatives or as projects developed in the Community Lane that create value for Pentaho subscription customers. Pentaho will provide official support based on current support policies to projects on the Customer Lane.
   1. Development Phase: Start up phase of an internal project. Usually a Labs experiment.
   2. Snapshot Release: Unstable and unsupported branch, not recommended for production use.
   3. Limited Release: Assistence given by Services Development with no contractual support for production environments.
   4. Production Release: Production release with PM assigned, fully supported as part of the Pentaho release cycle. 
* __Community Lane__: The Community Lane will be used for projects created by Pentaho Consulting or Engineering Services, in which case they will be managed so they do not conflict with the long-term architecture and functionality planned in the Pentaho product roadmap.
  1. Development Phase: Start up phase of an internal project. Usually a Labs experiment.
  2. Snapshot Release: Unstable and unsupported branch, not recommended for production use.
  3. Stable Release: Adoption is ramping up and product could be used in production environments.
  4. Mature Release: Indicates a successfully adopted project in a mature state.

How do I test a marketplace entry ?
-----------------------------------
Create a file marketplaces.xml in your .kettle folder
The content of this file will be :

    <marketplaces>
        <marketplace>
            <name>Pentaho Data Integration Marketplace</name>
                <entries_url>{local path to your marketplace.xml file}</entries_url>
        </marketplace>
    </marketplaces>



Example :

    <marketplaces>
        <marketplace>
            <name>Pentaho Data Integration Marketplace</name>
                <entries_url>/home/matt/git/pentaho/marketplace-metadata/marketplace.xml</entries_url>
        </marketplace>
    </marketplaces>
