XML Plugin Format
-----------------
The Marketplace XML is shared between Pentaho's BA Server and Spoon, but at 
this time there are some feature differences.  Each element below specifies whether it's available in the two marketplaces.

    <market_entry>
      <id>MY_ID</id> <!-- The ID is used to uniquely identify this plugin in the system (Both) -->
      <type>Platform</type> <!-- The type of the plugin tells the marketplace how to install the plugin, and where it's applicable. (Both)

What is the review process for the plugin?
------------------------------------------
At this time, the review process is informal, and can be done by any of the core 
committers of the marketplace-metadata project.  The core committers will review 
the plugin submission, and if accepted, will accept the pull request.

  
Version.xml: What is it and why should I use it?
------------------------------------------
 
version.xml is a file used by marketplace to determine which version of your plugin your user has installed.
This will allow the marketplace to tell the user when a new version is available and he can update your plugin.
The version.xml file should be located in the plugin root folder (where plugin.xml is) and it must follow
the following format:

<version branch='<branch>' buildId='<buildId>'><versionNumber></version>
 
 * <branch> - This should be the branch from where this build originated (stable or trunk, but you can use 
 whatever you want - GA, RC, etc)
 * <versionNumber> - The plugin version. Can be a complex string
 * <buildId> - This is used to differentiate between two versions who share the same version number. For instance,
 snapshot builds that usually have the same version (TRUNK-SNAPSHOT) can still be distinguished if the buildId is
 different.
